Assuming that you have a proper kde 4.*
development environment, run these
on the toggle-compositing/ directory:


~$ mkdir build
~$ cd build/
~$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=($KDEDIR) ../

(Where $KDEDIR your kde installation directory)

~$ make 
~$ make install

Test with :

~$ plasmoidviewer plasma_applet_toggle_compositing


Have fun !
