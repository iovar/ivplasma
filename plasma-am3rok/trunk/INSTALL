Assuming that you have a proper kde 4.*
development environment, run these
on the plasma-am3rok/ directory:


~$ mkdir build
~$ cd build/
~$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=($KDEDIR) ../

(Where $KDEDIR your kde installation directory.
e.g. mine is $HOME/kde)

~$ make 
~$ make install

Test with :

~$ plasmoidviewer plasma_applet_am3rok


Have fun !
